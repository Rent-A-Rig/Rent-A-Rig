						<b>Make each millisecond count</b> ASUS VG245H Full HD monitor is
						all about lag-free display of fast action—making it the perfect
						monitor for console gaming. The GameFast Input technology,
						ultra-fast 1ms response time, 75Hz refresh rate, AMD FreeSync
						technology and two low input lag HDMI ports work together to keep
						gameplay smooth and make your presses on the console almost
						instantly reflected on the screen. Intuition will take over even
						in the heat of action. Exclusive GamePlus offers four tactical
						tools such as crosshair and timer to make it easier to obliterate
						the enemies, while GameVisual provides six pre-set modes to
						optimize various types of content. Access to the tactical tool or
						pre-set mode you want only takes a press of a button. Its height-,
						swivel-, pivot-and tilt-adjustable design and eye-care
						technologies ensure your gaming monitor is always comfortable to
						view.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>GameFast Input Technology</b><br> Input lag is the time
						delay between pressing a button on your controller or keyboard and
						seeing its effect onscreen. High input lag will cause a slower
						connection giving you trouble keeping up with the fast-paced
						action. Input lag on an LCD monitor is typically much lower than a
						TV, and ASUS VG245H features GameFast Input Technology to further
						minimize input lag. This technology provides much faster motion
						delivery so you'll always be up to speed with in-game action at
						the precise timing you need to respond as quickly as is needed.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Lightning-fast 1ms response time and 75Hz refresh rate</b><br>ASUS
						VG245H boasts a 1ms response time so all your fast-paced gaming
						action will be rendered smoothly without smearing, ghosting and
						motion blur. You'll be able to react and respond quickly to what
						you see onscreen—a definite advantage in the gaming arena.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Dual HDMI flexible connectivity</b><br>ASUS VG245H
						features two HDMI ports, which is available to connect your media
						player, allowing you to connect your game console and another HDMI
						device at the same time. So there's no need to frequently plug and
						change your connection.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Super smooth visuals with AMD FreeSync</b><br>ASUS VG245H
						features AMD FreeSync technology to eliminate screen tearing and
						choppy frame rates to give you seamless visuals and smooth
						gameplay. This gives you the upper hand in first person shooters,
						racing, real-time strategy and sports titles.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>ASUS-exclusive GamePlus technology</b><br>ASUS VG245H
						features the ASUS-exclusive GamePlus hotkey to give you in-game
						enhancements that help you get more out of your game.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>ASUS-exclusive GameVisual technology</b><br>ASUS
						GameVisual Technology has six pre-set display modes to optimize
						visuals for different types of content. This unique feature can be
						easily accessed through a hotkey or the On Screen Display (OSD)
						settings menu.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Flicker-Free technology</b><br>Flicker-Free technology
						reduces flicker to give you a comfortable gaming experience. This
						minimizes instances of eyestrain and other potentially damaging
						eye ailments when you're embroiled in long, drawn-out gaming
						sessions.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Ultra-Low Blue Light technology</b><br>ASUS Ultra-Low Blue
						Light technology reduces the amount of harmful blue light. You can
						access and select four different filter settings onscreen easily
						through the OSD menu or DisplayWidget UI to find the best one that
						suits the task at hand.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Ergonomically designed and wall-mountable</b><br>ASUS
						VG245H is specially designed for long marathon gaming sessions.
						Its ergonomically-designed stand lets you adjust the tilt, swivel,
						pivot, and height of the monitor so you always find your ideal
						viewing position. It can also be VESA wall-mounted to fit in any
						limited space.
